        shocking cases and compelling real-life dramas with journalistic integrity
        and cutting-edge style. \n\nThis in-depth approach has earned the program
        and its teams numerous awards including three Peabodys, 17 Emmys and five
        RTNDA Edward R. Murrow Awards.\n\nThe program was revamped in 2002 when Lesley
        Stahl took over hosting duties from Dan Rather, and its name was changed to
        48 Hours Investigates. The name was changed again to 48 Hours Mystery in 2004,
        and with its single-topic format, it does not use a single host but is narrated
        by the reporter assigned to the story.\n\nThe current format of the documentary
        primarily deals with real life mysteries and crime stories, again with just
        one mystery per episode, owing to its single topic per show heritage. The
        program is not confined to reporting mysteries; CBS often uses the 48 Hours
        title or timeslot to present special reports on events, such as a 2006 report
        on the fifth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks, or coverage of
        the Virginia Tech massacre in April 2007. However, the relationship between

        - April 16th, 2011","overview":"Gary Lineker introduces highlights from the
        Premier League. Reigning champions Chelsea travel to the Hawthorns to face
        West Bromwich Albion, who have lost their last 11 games against the Blues
        in both league and cup matches, and were thrashed 6-0 at Stamford Bridge on
        the opening day of the season. New boss Roy Hodgson, who replaced former Chelsea
        favourite Roberto Di Matteo in February, will need to tighten up the Baggies''
        defence if they are to beat the drop. Two more sides battling for survival
        meet at Bloomfield Road, where Blackpool host Wigan. The Latics will be desperate
        to avenge the 4-0 mauling they suffered against the Seasiders back in August.
        Sunderland boss Steve Bruce faces his former club Birmingham at St Andrew''s,
        while Everton meet Blackburn and West Ham face Aston Villa.","url":"http://trakt.tv/show/match-of-the-day/season/2010/episode/33","first_aired":1302937200,"images":{"screen":"http://trakt.us/images/fanart/634-940.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":0,"votes":0,"loved":0,"hated":0}}},{"show":{"title":"ProzhektorPerisHilton","year":2008,"url":"http://trakt.tv/show/prozhektorperishilton","first_aired":1211007600,"country":null,"overview":"","runtime":30,"network":"\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439
