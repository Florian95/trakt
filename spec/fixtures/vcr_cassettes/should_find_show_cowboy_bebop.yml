        thus the need for those who hunt criminals. The solar system police reinstated
        the bounty system of the Wild West. Cowboy Bebop is the story of the four
        inhabitants of the spaceship Bebop, and the living they barely make at bounty

        three cattle-ranching families, alike in their tough, tenacious and headstrong
        approach, but who get the job done in distinctly different ways. The smallest
        of the three ranches is owned by Scott and Stacey Hughes, who alone manage
        a 12,000-acre plot filled with 500 Black Angus. By contrast, the Galt Ranch
        is one of Montana''s largest, so big -- more than 100,000 acres -- that owner
        Bill Galt uses modern technology, including his own helicopter, to look after
        5,500 cattle and 100 horses. And then there are the Stuckys, traditional ranchers
        who choose to ride on horseback instead of motorized vehicles and do most
        of the work by hand.","runtime":60,"network":"Animal Planet","air_day":"Monday","air_time":"7:00pm","certification":"","imdb_id":"","tvdb_id":"166031","tvrage_id":"25650","images":{"poster":"http://trakt.us/images/poster-small.jpg","fanart":"http://trakt.us/images/fanart-summary.jpg","banner":"http://trakt.us/images/banners/17937.jpg"},"ratings":{"percentage":0,"votes":0,"loved":0,"hated":0},"genres":["Reality"]}]'
