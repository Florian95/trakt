        and came back to life. The one-hour series features six episodes and premieres
        Sunday, December 5 at 10PM ET/9PM CT/11PM PT on BIO Channel. \"I Survived...
        Beyond and Back\" reveals one of life''s greatest mysteries by profiling the
        extraordinary stories of people who have literally passed on to the other
        side. The series combines the compelling and emotionally gripping stories
        of \"I Survived...\" with the unexplainable experiences some people have when

        from the medical personnel and family members who were present, \"I Survived...
