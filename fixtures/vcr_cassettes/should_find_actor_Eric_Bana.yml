        Bana is an Australian film and television actor. He began his career as a
        comedian in the sketch comedy series Full Frontal before gaining critical
        recognition in the biopic Chopper (2000). After a decade of roles in Australian
        TV shows and films, Bana gained Hollywood''s attention by playing the role
        of American Delta Force Sergeant Norm \"Hoot\" Hooten in Black Hawk Down (2001),
        the lead role as Bruce Banner in the Ang Lee directed film Hulk (2003), Prince
        Hector in the movie Troy (2004), the lead in Steven Spielberg''s Munich (2005),
        and the villain Nero in the science-fiction film Star Trek (2009).\n\nAn accomplished
        dramatic actor and comedian, he received Australia''s highest film and television
        awards for his performances in Chopper, Full Frontal and Romulus, My Father.
        Bana performs predominantly in leading roles in a variety of low-budget and
        major studio films, ranging from romantic comedies and drama to science fiction
        and action thrillers.\n\nEric Bana was the younger of two children; he has
        a brother, Anthony. He is of Croatian ancestry on his father''s side. Bana''s
        paternal grandfather, Mate Banadinovi\u0107, fled to Argentina after the Second
        World War, and Bana''s paternal grandmother emigrated to Germany and then
        to Australia in the 1950s with her son, Ivan (Bana''s father). His father
        was a logistics manager for Caterpillar, Inc., and his German-born mother,
        Eleanor, was a hairdresser. Bana grew up in Melbourne''s Tullamarine, a suburban
        area on the western edge of the city, near the main airport. In a cover story
        for The Mail on Sunday, he told author Antonella Gambotto-Burke that his family
        had suffered from racist taunts, and that it had distressed him. \"Wog is
        such a terrible word,\" he said. He has stated: \"I have always been proud
        of my origin, which had a big influence on my upbringing. I have always been
        in the company of people of European origin\".\n\nShowing acting skill early
        in life, Bana began doing impressions of family members at the age of six
        or seven, first mimicking his grandfather''s walk, voice and mannerisms. In
        school, he mimicked his teachers as a means to get out of trouble. As a teen,
        he watched the Mel Gibson film Mad Max (1979), and decided he wanted to become
        an actor. However, he did not seriously consider a career in the performing
        arts until 1991 when he was persuaded to try stand-up comedy while working
        as a barman at Melbourne''s Castle Hotel. His stand-up gigs in inner-city
        pubs did not provide him with enough income to support himself, so he continued
        his work as a barman and bussing tables.","birthday":"1968-08-09","birthplace":"Melbourne,
