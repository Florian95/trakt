        seating and service while the other manages back-of-house matters like menu
        planning, shopping and, of course, cooking. When the doors open, each restaurant
        serves a discerning group of diners, along with Scott and a rotating panel
        of judges representing three areas of expertise: restaurant marketer, restaurant
        reviewer and restaurant investor. Based on the restaurant''s concept, execution
